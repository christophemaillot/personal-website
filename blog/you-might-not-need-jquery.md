Jquery is a very handy javascript toolbox for your web projects, that provides a lot of usefull functions and utilities. But comes with quite a big overhead.

You might not need the whole lot of functions provided by jquery but probably a small subset of what jquery provides.

The [http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/|http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/] website gives alternatives (that is native javascript snippets) to jquery methods.
